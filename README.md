## Previous Version
Unfortunately, the initial version of the **e-KG** project was lost due to a ransomware attack. This earlier version of the project did not work as a single file; instead, it utilized file handling to manage and display multiple files together whenever needed. While this approach had its benefits, the current version has been redesigned to function seamlessly as a single file, ensuring easier access and usability.
